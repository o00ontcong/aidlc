/**
 * End-to-end coverage for the Start Epic → recipe path that every entry point
 * (Builder button, Epics tab, navbar "Start Epic") funnels through once a
 * workspace.yaml exists:
 *
 *   classifyBriefForWebview → recipeId  →  startEpicInline
 *     → assembleRecipeForEpic → assemblePipeline(config, { recipeId, pipelineId })
 *
 * The webview methods live in the (untestable, vscode-bound) extension, but the
 * load-bearing logic is all core: build the built-in workspace exactly as the
 * extension materializes it, then prove every recipe the classifier can pick
 * assembles into a valid, named pipeline. If any built-in recipe stopped being
 * assemblable, Start Epic would surface "cannot generate from recipe" — these
 * pin that contract.
 *
 * loadBuiltinPreset composes the workspace structure in-memory; only skill
 * markdown is read from disk (with placeholder fallbacks), so a bogus extension
 * path is fine here — we only assert on structure, not skill bodies.
