/**
 * Two-layer command model — GH-71.
 *
 * Replaces the one-command-per-(pipeline × phase) fan-out
 * (`<pipelineId>-<phaseId>`, see {@link pipelineCommandId}) with:
 *
 *   1. **Shortcut layer** — a fixed set of phase commands (`/plan`, `/design`,
 *      …) shared across all pipelines, no pipeline prefix. Count is fixed at
 *      the number of canonical phases; adding a pipeline adds zero commands.
 *   2. **Backbone dispatcher** — a single `/aidlc <epic> [phase]` that resolves
 *      composition at runtime via `epic → its pipeline → phase` and, with no
 *      phase arg, runs the next eligible phase.
 *
 * Composition is resolved from the epic's *pipeline binding* (its run
 * `state.json` → `pipelineId` → that pipeline's step wiring), never from the
 * command name. So two pipelines that reuse a phase name with different
 * agent/skill wiring never share composition — {@link resolveComposition} keys
 * off the pipeline, not the command.
 *
 * This module is pure TypeScript. The command *files* it generates are Claude
 * Code slash-command markdown; the runtime resolution they describe is carried
 * out by Claude reading `state.json` + `workspace.yaml` at invocation time
 * (there is no JS in a `.md` command), which is why the composition logic here
 * is also exposed as pure functions the extension + tests can call directly.

# AIDLC dispatcher

You were invoked as \`/aidlc <epic> [phase]\` with arguments: \`$ARGUMENTS\`.
The first token is the **epic id**; an optional second token is the **phase**.

## 1. Bind the epic to its pipeline

1. Read \`${epicRoot}/<epic>/state.json\`. Note \`pipelineId\` (the pipeline this
   epic is bound to) and the per-step \`status\` list. If the file is missing,
   tell the user the epic isn't started and stop.

## 2. Choose the phase

- **If a phase was given**, use it. Validate it is a step in the epic's
  pipeline (see step 3). If it isn't, tell the user which phases the pipeline
  *does* have and stop.
- **If no phase was given**, pick the **next eligible phase**: the first step
  that is \`awaiting_work\`, else the first \`rejected\` step, else the first
  \`pending\` step whose every \`depends_on\` is \`approved\`. If none is
  actionable (all approved or paused for review), say so and stop.

## 3. Resolve composition from the pipeline (never from the command name)

1. Read \`.aidlc/workspace.yaml\`. Find the pipeline whose \`id\` === \`pipelineId\`.
2. In that pipeline's \`steps\`, find the step whose \`name\` (or \`agent\` when
   unnamed) === the chosen phase. That step's \`agent\` + \`skills\` are the
   wiring. If the step omits \`skills\`, use the referenced agent's \`skills:\`.
3. Load the persona from \`.claude/agents/<agent>.md\` (fall back to
   \`~/.claude/agents/<agent>.md\`), and each skill from
   \`.claude/skills/<skill>.md\` (fall back to \`~/.claude/skills/<skill>.md\`).
   Adopt the persona and follow the skill instructions.

If the active SDLC standard (\`standard:\` in workspace.yaml, or a per-epic
override) is \`none\`, skip the persona/skill (opinion) layer and act as plain
Claude — but still follow the structural contract below.

## 4. Structural contract (always applies, every profile)

1. Read \`${epicRoot}/<epic>/state.json\` for prior feedback/history and address
   any rejection reasons or \`bug_report\` rounds in this revision. Previously
   reported bugs remain in scope.
2. Read \`${epicRoot}/<epic>/inputs.json\` for capability inputs.
   Read \`${epicRoot}/<epic>/USER-NOTE.md\` FIRST when it exists (same as \`user_note\`).
   If \`jira\` is set, that is the ticket key — the body is already in \`state.json\` description; do not wait for Jira MCP.
   If \`user_note\` / USER-NOTE.md is present, it outranks \`state.json\` description. ${USER_NOTE_PRIORITY_RULE}
3. Write your output to \`${epicRoot}/<epic>/artifacts/<FILE>\` where \`<FILE>\`
   is the step's declared artifact, or the phase's conventional file. The AIDLC
   validator checks this path when the step is marked done.
4. Summarize what you produced and tell the user to click **"Mark step done"**
   in the AIDLC panel. Canvas-gated steps open the review canvas after that click.

Run the **\`${phase.id}\`** phase for this epic by following the AIDLC dispatch
procedure exactly as \`/aidlc <epic> ${phase.id}\` would:

1. Read \`${epicRoot}/<epic>/state.json\` → \`pipelineId\`.
2. In \`.aidlc/workspace.yaml\`, find that pipeline and its \`${phase.id}\` step
   (\`name\`/\`agent\` === \`${phase.id}\`). Use that step's \`agent\` + \`skills\` —
   never assume; two pipelines can wire \`${phase.id}\` differently.
3. **If the pipeline has no \`${phase.id}\` step**, tell the user this epic's
   pipeline (\`<pipelineId>\`) has no \`${phase.id}\` phase, suggest
   \`/aidlc <epic>\` to run the next eligible phase, and stop.
4. Otherwise load the persona (\`.claude/agents/<agent>.md\`) + skill(s)
   (\`.claude/skills/<skill>.md\`), adopt them (unless the active standard is
   \`none\`), then follow the structural contract: read state/inputs, write to
