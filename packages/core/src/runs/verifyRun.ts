/**
 * Post-run drift check for a completed (or in-flight) run.
 *
 * After a step passes the gate, its resolved `produces` paths are recorded in
 * `StepRecord.artifactsProduced`. Nothing stops a human from later deleting or
 * gutting one of those files — the run state still says "approved". `verifyRun`
 * re-checks every recorded artifact (existence + the same `produces_contains`
 * content assertions the gate applied) and reports which steps have drifted.
 *
 * Pure read-only: mirrors the filesystem reads in `markStepDone`'s gate, never
 * mutates state, never throws. The CLI `run verify` command renders the result.
