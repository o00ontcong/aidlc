/**
 * Persistent state for an in-flight pipeline run.
 *
 * One run = one execution of one pipeline against one "subject" (typically an
 * epic key like `EPIC-2100`, but the runner is agnostic — `runId` is just a
 * filesystem-safe identifier). State files live at
 * `<workspace>/.aidlc/runs/<runId>.json` and act as the single source of
 * truth for what step the user is on, which steps passed/failed, and what
 * feedback the human supplied on rejected steps.
 *
 * The state machine is intentionally simple in phase 1:
 *
 *   awaiting_work  → user runs the slash command externally, comes back to
 *                    "Mark step done"
 *   awaiting_review → step produced its artifacts; pause for human approve
 *                     / reject
 *   approved       → step passed; runner advances currentStepIdx
 *   rejected       → step rejected by human; user can rerun (revision++)
 *
 * Phase 2 will add: gate-check on `requires` paths, hooks (before/after
 * step), reject-to-upstream cascade, automatic worker dispatch via the
 * runner registry.
