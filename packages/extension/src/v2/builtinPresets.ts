/**
 * Built-in workflow presets.
 *
 * The implementation now lives in `@aidlc/core` (`presets/builtinWorkflows`)
 * so the CLI and the extension share one source of truth for the SDLC
 * pipeline shape, phase definitions, command naming, and preset composition.
 *
 * This module is a thin re-export kept so the extension's existing import
 * sites (`./builtinPresets`) keep working unchanged. The template `.md` files
 * still ship with the extension under `templates/`, and `loadBuiltinPreset`
 * reads them via the `extensionPath` argument the callers already pass.
