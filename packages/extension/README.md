Keep durable project context in `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT.md`, `STATUS.md`, and `DECISIONS.md`; run each focused task through a pipeline declared in `workspace.yaml`. The VS Code UI and CLI share the same repository state.

### New in 2.5

- 🧭 **Selectable SDLC standard** — pick a compliance **profile** (`none` · `agile-lite` · `hybrid` · `iso-ieee`) that governs, in a single selector, the enforced artifact sections, the requirements-**traceability** validator (FR → AC → test case → result, plus RTM checks), and the per-phase persona/skill. Choose it from a card-based **webview picker** (sidebar ⚖️ button or **“AIDLC: Select SDLC Standard”**), from a dropdown when you **Start Epic**, or by hand in `workspace.yaml`. Default is `none` — nothing enforced, fully backward-compatible. The traceability validator is phase-progressive (a rule only fires once the artifact it checks exists) and wires into the existing auto-review gate. Custom profiles live in `.aidlc/profiles/<name>.yaml`.
- ⌨️ **Two-layer command model** — alongside the per-pipeline commands, AIDLC now generates a fixed set of shortcut phase commands (`/plan`, `/design`, `/implement`, `/unit-test`, `/benchmark`, `/test-plan`, `/generate-test-cases`, `/execute-test`) plus a single **`/aidlc <epic> [phase]`** dispatcher. Composition is resolved at runtime from the epic’s bound pipeline (so two pipelines that reuse a phase name never collide), and `/aidlc <epic>` with no phase runs the **next eligible** step.

### New in 2.4

- 🆕 **annotron 0.6** — the bundled browser review editor jumps from 0.3 to 0.6. Annotations now **persist** to a sidecar beside the artifact (survive reload/restart), each annotation gets its own **conversation thread** with inline replies, clicking a card **jumps to and highlights** the element, and an **Annotations / History** tab split lists past feedback rounds. You can **paste or upload images** into the message box or any annotation note (saved to `.annotron-uploads/`), **copy** agent messages, watch a **live step log** stream the agent's work, and **cancel** an in-flight round.

### New in 2.3

- 🖍️ **Open HTML vs. Feedback, split** — the artifact menu now has two distinct actions: **Open HTML** (appears once a render exists; opens the rendered page read-only in your browser) and **Feedback** (renders the HTML first if needed, then opens annotron for the review loop). The annotate terminal is also recreated when its previous session has exited, so Feedback always launches instead of re-focusing a dead terminal.

### New in 2.2

- 🖍️ **Annotate artifacts in a browser** — open any epic artifact in [annotron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/annotron) (bundled, no separate install), point-and-click your feedback, and Claude applies it **back to the Markdown** and re-renders. Markdown→HTML is a zero-dependency Node render (no Python).
- 🕑 **Revision history** — every change is snapshotted and attributed (git identity / hostname), viewable in the History panel and in the rendered HTML, with a selector to reopen any past revision.
- 🧠 **Epic memory** — a compact per-epic digest (decisions / constraints / reflections) so continuing an epic with any agent is cheap on tokens. Opt-in **Memory auto-load** toggle injects it into context whenever you work on that epic.
- 🔀 **git-aware AST graph** — the code graph rescans on save (incremental) and does a full rescan after branch switch / merge / rebase / pull.
- 💻 All of the above works from the terminal too via the `aidlc` CLI (`aidlc globals install`).

## Features

- **Project Overview** — shared project brief, status, decisions, working agreement, task counts, active work, and direct links into each task. Initialization creates only missing files and never overwrites existing content
- **Workspace Builder** — main-area panel with agent / skill / pipeline cards, reorder, on-failure toggle, inline skill editor
- **Analyze Requirements** — import requirements from **Jira**, **GitHub Issues**, **Linear**, **Redmine**, or a local file into a `requirements.md` in your project. The "Analyze" tab in the Builder drives the interactive wizard; `aidlc analyze` does the same from the terminal
- **Test Agent** — a "Tests" tab that integrates [`aidlc-testagent`](https://github.com/aidlc-io/aidlc-testagent) (`ata`) for AI-powered E2E tests. Shows the full **Explore → Plan → Confirm → Generate → Execute → Heal → Verdict** pipeline, lists targets from `testagent.config.yaml` with per-target **Plan** / **Run** buttons and a settings editor — no terminal needed for day-to-day test runs
- **Tasks & runs** — bind a pipeline to a focused work item, then walk it step-by-step. **Approve** advances; **reject** cascades feedback to the producing step (auto-resets downstream); **rerun** with optional new context. Runs display by **step name**, not agent name
- **Annotate artifacts + epic memory** — click a step's `.md` → **Open Markdown**, **Open HTML** (read-only, once rendered), or **Feedback**: renders the Markdown to a Claude-styled HTML (zero-dep, no Python) and opens it in **annotron** for point-and-click review; feedback is applied back to the `.md` with an attributed **revision history** (reopen any past revision) shown in the History panel. Each epic keeps a compact **Memory** (decisions / constraints / reflections) behind the footer's **Memory** button, with an opt-in **Memory auto-load** toggle (top of the Epics list) that feeds an epic's memory into context whenever you work on it. Tools auto-install into `~/.claude` on activation; your `settings.json` is only touched when you flip that toggle
- **Smart New Task** — describe the outcome in one line and AIDLC suggests a task-type **recipe** (`bugfix`, `small-feature`, `refactor`, `feature-parallel`, `large-feature`, `spike`) and assembles the pipeline. No pipeline yet? Load the SDLC example or create one inline
- **Selectable SDLC standard** — one `standard:` selector (`none` · `agile-lite` · `hybrid` · `iso-ieee`, or a custom `.aidlc/profiles/<name>.yaml`) drives enforced artifact sections, the requirements-**traceability** validator, and per-phase persona/skill. Pick it from the card-based webview (sidebar ⚖️ / command palette), at Start Epic, or by editing `workspace.yaml`; an unknown value is rejected when the workspace loads
- **AIDLC Monitor** — a status bar item plus a panel with **Token Usage**, **Insights**, and **Agents** tabs. The Agents tab embeds the [agents-observe](https://github.com/simple10/agents-observe) dashboard to watch live agent sessions and history. When the server is down it offers a one-click **Start Monitor** that can auto-install the plugin (Docker if available, otherwise a local runtime — no Docker required)
- **Session Insights** — a native dashboard built entirely from the Claude Code transcript (`~/.claude/projects/**.jsonl`) — no plugin, no server, no Docker. Session picker plus seven panels: overview, context+cache chart over turns, hooks (with errors), agents/subagents, prompts, context management (compactions / peak / file edits), retrieval and tool usage. Updates live while a session runs
- **Live OTel strip** — a minimal OTLP/JSON receiver for Claude Code's native telemetry, with one-click "enable telemetry" that writes the env to `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Sidebar webview** — clickable **Agents / Skills / Flows / Tasks** tiles that open the matching view, plus live counts and active runs
- **Load Demo Project** — one click drops a full SDLC pipeline + 6 sample epics into `.aidlc/`, no YAML to write
- **Add Skill wizard** — 4 sources: load template, paste markdown, upload a `.md` file, or open a blank file. Starter templates: hello-world, code-reviewer, test-converter, doc-writer, release-notes
- **Add Agent wizard** — id, display name, skill picker, model picker (Sonnet 4.6 / Opus 4.7 / Haiku 4.5)
- **Add Pipeline wizard** — pick each step's name then its agent, set **"Runs after"** dependencies and on-failure behavior (stop / continue); **rename**, **duplicate**, or **Load AIDLC default**. Slash commands are namespaced per pipeline so multiple pipelines never collide
- **Workspace templates** — save the whole workspace as a named preset and reapply it in any project. Built-ins: `code-review`, `release-notes`, `sdlc`
- **Built-in Claude CLI terminal** — one-click zsh terminal in the bottom panel with the `claude` CLI auto-launched
- **Workspace inspector** — dump the parsed, validated, env-resolved `workspace.yaml` to the output channel
- **Interactive walkthrough** — open the Welcome page → "Get started with AIDLC" for a 6-step tour

## How It Works

The extension reads `.aidlc/workspace.yaml` from the open folder and uses [`@aidlc/core`](../core) to validate the schema (Zod), resolve env variables, load skills and agents, and execute pipelines through the Claude CLI runner.

```
.aidlc/
├── workspace.yaml          # agents · skills · pipelines · sidebar layout
├── skills/                 # markdown prompts for each skill
├── epics/                  # work items bound to a pipeline
└── runs/                   # state of every run, watched live by both UIs
```

Both the extension and the `aidlc` CLI read and write the same files atomically — switch between them mid-run without losing state.

## Getting Started

1. Install **AIDLC** from the VS Code Marketplace or Open VSX.
2. Open a workspace folder.
3. Open **AIDLC Workspace → Project** and create the missing shared-context files.
4. Open **Tasks → New Task**, describe one outcome, and choose a pipeline.
5. Review the task artifacts, diff, and test results before completing it.
6. Update shared status and decisions so the next task knows what changed.

Prefer to start from scratch? Use **AIDLC: Init Sample Workspace** instead — it scaffolds an empty `.aidlc/workspace.yaml` plus a `hello-skill.md`.
